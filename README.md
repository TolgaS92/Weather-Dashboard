## About
- Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

-Our goal is to retreve weather data for cities, with using third-party Api's and `localstorage` to create interactive weather forecast website.
